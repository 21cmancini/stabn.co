## How to push your changes to github
1. Make changes to your files
2. Once you are done making changes, you need to **ADD** your files to the **COMMIT**
  * `git add -A` adds ALL of your files (this is not a best practice)
  * `git add css/*` adds ALL the files in the css folder
  * `git add css/styles.css` adds ONLY the styles.css file
3. After adding the files, create a **COMMIT** with a message
  * `git commit -m "this is what I did"`
4. **Push** your files to github
  * `git push -u origin master`


## Git Commands
* `git status` = this lets you see which changes have been made
* `git pull` = pull down any changes. Use this command to update your repository.

## Terminal Commands
* `cd css` = change directory into the css folder. Replace 'css' with any other folder name
* `cd ..` = go back one directory
* `ls` = list all files in the current directory
* `ls -A` = list EVERYTHING even the hidden files
